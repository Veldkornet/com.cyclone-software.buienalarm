## BuienAlarm app for Homey  

This is an unofficial implementation for the BuienAlarm App on Homey. It uses data from BuitenAlarm.nl
It is based on Buienradar but I prefer BuienAlarm for better data. That is the reason why I implemented this. 

The app is using you longitude and latitude to determain the location to check for rain.

This application is only working in the Netherlands and Belgium (**untested**)

## Version

### V1.0.0
This is the first beta version of BuienAlarm App.
